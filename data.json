He is a UNDP Goodwill Ambassador, drawing attention to critical issues such as gender equality and climate change.\n\nCoster-Waldau was born in Rudk\u00f8bing, Denmark, the son of Hanne S\u00f8borg Coster, a librarian, and J\u00f8rgen Oscar Fritzer Waldau (died 1998).

Coster-Waldau was the youngest actor to enter the Danish National School of Theatre and Contemporary Dance (Danish: Statens Teaterskole), where he was educated from 1989 to 1993.\n\nIn 2001, he began his U.S. career in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down as Medal of Honor recipient Gary Gordon. Coster-Waldau says \"My first U.S. movie was Black Hawk Down and a friend helped me put myself on tape up on the attic over my apartment in Copenhagen. We shipped it out and I got lucky.\"\n\nSince April 2011, Coster-Waldau has played Jaime Lannister in the HBO hit series Game of Thrones, based on George R. R. Martin's best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novel series. He commented about the character \"What's not to like about Jaime? As an actor I couldn't ask for a better role\". For his role as Jaime Lannister he has received several accolades, including Primetime Emmy Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Critics' Choice Television Award, Saturn Award and People's Choice Award nominations.\n\nIn 2011, he also starred alongside Sam Shepard in Mateo Gil's feature Blackthorn, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival.
